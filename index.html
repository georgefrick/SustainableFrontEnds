                    This comes down to being able to prioritize business needs so that we can react to a changing
                    business world.
                    You cannot build credibility with the business if requests often mean starting
                    over, or you give the impression you didn't plan for change.
                    We don't always want to be rebuilding software, we want to be build a platform of incremental
                    capability.

                    You'll also want a set of coding standards, which these days can be codified into a .editorconfig
                    file and put into the repo with the projects code. I'd still have a document, or officially
                    reference
                    and existing one. Start at editorconfig.org
                    <hr/>
                    How will you roll on new developers? What do they need to know.

                    <li>Data</li>
                    <li>Company wide concern</li>
                    <li>Principle of least privilege</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <ul>
                        <li>data should never arrive from server</li>
                        <li>server should block actions</li>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    I want to mention security briefly; it shouldn't be as much the concern of the front end architect
                    as the back end. It should be a company wide concern, and be based on the principle of least
                    privilege. You should not hide data the user doesn't have access to; it should never arrive
                    from the server. You should not hide actions the user can't take - someone will fire up postman
                    and send the request by hand. Security has to be an onion.

                    What will your build process look like? Will you rely on the framework? Do you have a dedicated
                    dev ops team? Is some of this prescribed by the organization. You want to choose an approach
                    that integrates well here.
                    <hr/>
                    Look at how you will compile, package and deploy your project. It may be completely out of your
                    control, or entirely your responsibility and that changes the scope of what you have to get done.

                <aside class="notes">
                    In the new JavaScript world, this has become a lot more important. Developers are turning to
                    Yarn and lock files to keep versions of dependencies fixed. These things are break on us all
                    the time!
                    <hr/>
                    We're going to look at this later - but a good thing to note here - NPM modules can be stored
                    in Nexus, JFrog, and host of other platforms.
                    <hr/>
                    But more central to our point of sustainability; plan for third party services. If you get the
                    weather from a web service; you should consider how you are going to sustain that going forward.
                    They could go out of business, or completely change how their API works. They could raise prices.

                    I want to very briefly mention monitoring, especially in the modern cloud world. It's gotten very
                    easy to monitor our applications and get insights. Start this early; watch your development server
                    like you would production. Tools like Application Insights on Azure, Data Dog and BugSnag are great.

                <aside class="notes">
                    I've kept this for last. Because we seem to put it first. We'll use framework X because it's faster.
                    Faster than what? Is page response time our most important metric? How many users will we have?
                    <hr/>
                    It's important to prioritize and focus on what is important here, based on your situation and
                    requirements. You might focus on security and low error rates for patient billing, while focusing
                    on traffic and response times for your marketing and home page. This could be an entire conference.

                    Let's finally talk frameworks. Maybe your project is small and you don't have any special
                    requirements.
                    Maybe you think this step is "done", because you are "A React house" and you build everything in
                    React.
                    <hr/>
                    But let's just take a look at some architectural alternatives you might make based on your
                    information.
                    For example, a lot of bloggers and small companies look at their requirements and choose Word Press,
                    and they experience a lot of success.

                    While many people will use mocking tools; I prefer to build out a static website -
                    users can see navigation and get a feel for how they’ll use the app.

                    You can build generated static sites using frameworks like Jekyll or wintersmith and languages like
                    Go.
                    Sometimes, users desire more interactivity.
                    Handle change better than a static site

                    You can get information from a database, web service, without the security concerns of api traffic.
                    Another benefit of using a static site generator, as the templates and any code can be used to
                    kick-start a more in-depth project.
                    This makes for an inherently more secure and performant dashboard - just regenerate the site on a
                    cycle and don't worry about what the front
                    end is allowed to do.

                    A multipage application can still be appropriate and actually strong when you are attempting to get
                    the advantages of SPAs and deal with specific disadvantages. There is actually a small but growing
                    idea here that follow that of micro-services. Micro-front ends. By going back to multi page
                    applications, but using SPA tools and frameworks; we can minimize problems like architectural
                    change, SEO, and complexity.

                    Traditionally a multi-page application would imply MVC and would be tied to some kind of non-restful
                    (or non graph-ql) back end. Forcing developers to work on both, and I don’t recommend that approach.

                    What I can recommend is there can be benefits to building more, smaller applications. As we’ve seen
                    through this talk - you can identify and architect each application according to it’s needs.

                    MPAs have the disadvantage of complexity of management. As the number of projects goes up,
                    maintenance, new features and overall organization can suffer. It takes an approach that manages the
                    applications as a portfolio to do this well.

                    automate
                    the update in a more compatible way.
